# Style Guide (Flashcard-First)

## Structure (in order)
1. **Formula** (first, no prose before it)
2. **Parameters** (short bullet list)
3. **What it means** (1–2 lines, smaller)
4. **What it's used for** (1–3 bullets)
5. **Key properties**
6. **Common gotchas**
7. **Example** (required)
8. **See also** (optional)

## Typography intent
- Formula is the hero: large and visually dominant.
- Parameters are medium.
- Explanatory text is smaller, like an old-school encyclopedia.

## Content rules
- Max ~1 screenful per card.
- Keep “Common gotchas” on every card.
- Avoid long paragraphs; prefer crisp bullets.
