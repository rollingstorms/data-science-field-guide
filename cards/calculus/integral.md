# Integral

<div class="formula" markdown="1">
## Formula
\[
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx
\]

\[
\frac{d}{dx}\int^x f(t)\,dt = f(x)
\]

</div>
<div class="parameters" markdown="1">
## Parameters
- \(f(x)\): integrand
- \([a,b]\): interval of integration

</div>
## What it means
An integral accumulates quantities (often area under a curve) over an interval.

## What it's used for
- Areas, accumulated change, and continuous probability.
- Solving differential and physical models.

## Key properties
- Linear operator.
- Linked to derivatives by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

## Common gotchas
- Indefinite and definite integrals are different objects.
- Bounds and variable of integration are easy to mishandle.

## Example
\(\int_0^1 x\,dx = 1/2\).
