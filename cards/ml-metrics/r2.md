# R^2 (Coefficient of Determination)

<div class="formula" markdown="1">
## Formula
\[
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_i (y_i-\hat y_i)^2}{\sum_i (y_i-\bar y)^2}
\]

</div>
<div class="parameters" markdown="1">
## Parameters
- \(y_i\): true value
- \(\hat y_i\): prediction
- \(\bar y\): sample mean of \(y_i\)

</div>
## What it means
Fraction of variance in \(y\) explained by the model.



## What it's used for
- Regression model comparison on the same dataset.
- Quick diagnostic for goodness of fit.

## Key properties
- \(R^2=1\) is perfect fit.
- Can be negative if the model is worse than predicting \(\bar y\).

## Common gotchas
- Not comparable across different datasets.
- Can increase with more features even if they are not useful.

## Example
If \(\sum (y_i-\hat y_i)^2=20\) and \(\sum (y_i-\bar y)^2=50\),
then \(R^2=1-20/50=0.6\).
